This project is was an independent study project at Colorado College 
by Jordan Haber, Sam Johnson and Andrew Pope.

This program is meant to produce virtual terrain in OpenGL. The terrain and textures
are procedurally generated at runtime and as the user moves through the scene. As the
user moves, new 'tiles' of terrain are created and seamlessly added to the scene. When
the user moves back to older tiles, the old ones are loaded again.

This program was written on computers using OpenGL 1.4. We've had problems with the
multiproccessing library used in creating and loading the terrain while the program 
is running on newer versions.

The code's super messy. We'll clean it up eventually.
